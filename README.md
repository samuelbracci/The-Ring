Currently the game is unfinished, but right now you can do battles with the one class in the game, the Fighter.

What you can do:

-Fight regular turn based battles with 3 difficulty options and a fourth practice option.

-Access some menu options

What I plan to add:

-Finish functionality of the other menu options

-Class abilities that allow you to use a one time skill during battle 

-More classes

-The ability to fight another person next to you locally, you both choose a class and do battle

Even though this game is small and unfinished, I appreciate anyone checking it out :)
